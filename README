EnigmaÂ² for Cubox-i/Hummingboard - pre pre pre alpha 0.0.0.0.1 :D


Release Notes
-------------
This is a port of the famous Enigma2 System from Dream-Multimedia.
Since it is now closed source and i've used an openpli fork,
based on the old opensource and gpl'ed version from DMM.

This piece of work was mainly tested on the cubox-i 4pro by Solidrun ( http://www.solid-run.com ).
Minor tests were done on the Hummingboard i2ex.


How to Setup
------------
f.ex. to build an environment in /development/hummingboard/openpli40

$ mkdir -p /development/hummingboard/openpli40
$ cd /development/hummingboard/openpli40
$ git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/openpli/openpli-oe-core
$ cd openpli-oe-core
$ make

# edit site.conf and build/conf/local.conf to your needs ...

# add meta-fsl-arm(-extra) and this layer

 - Internet Streaming ( MediaPortal as example included ... )

Whats NOT Working
-----------------
 - A/V in LIVE-TV ( see todo )

Other Notes:
------------
 - On the first boot the parition  "/dev/mmcblk0p2", will be resized to fit the sdcard ... 
	( proper credits to rpi-wiggle ... and ... please wait few minutes ... ;) )
 - actually all is running in 720p 
	( A/V on fb0 and OSD on fb1 )
 - for audio is alsa card 1 in use 
	( HDMI on cb, hb needs maybe card 2, else spdif is used, see "/etc/asound.conf" )
 - to use your own remote, have a look at "/usr/bin/enigma2_pre_start.sh" 
	( see how to find and load the right keymap - hint: ir-keytable )
